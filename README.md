## Transfer learning for Time Series Forecasting
Transfer learning refers to the process of pre-training a flexible model on a large dataset and using it later on other data with little to no training. It is one of the most outstanding ðŸš€ achievements in Machine Learning ðŸ§  and has many practical applications.

For time series forecasting, the technique allows you to get lightning-fast predictions âš¡ bypassing the tradeoff between accuracy and speed.

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uFCO2UBpH-5l2fk3KmxfU0oupsOC6v2n?authuser=0&pli=1#cell-5=) shows how to generate a pre-trained model and store it in a checkpoint to make it available for public use to forecast new time series never seen by the model. 
If you want to see a proof of concept in action you can visit this [Demo](http://nixtla.io/transfer-learning/).

If you want to use our [Low Latency API](https://docs.nixtla.io/reference/forecast_forecast_post) for forecasting you can SingUp [here](http://18.235.133.135:3000/login). 

**You can contribute with your pre-trained models by following [this Notebook](https://github.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/blob/main/nbs/Transfer_Learning.ipynb) and sending us an email at azul[at]nixtla.io**

You can also take a look at list of pretrained models here.  Currently we have this ones avaiable in our [API](https://docs.nixtla.io/reference/neural_transfer_neural_transfer_post) or [Demo](http://nixtla.io/transfer-learning/). You can also download the `.ckpt`:
